# Web App Prototype README
In this programming, I modified the mockup according to the tutorial's suggestion, and added more input parts on this basis.
## Home Page
For the home page, this page is mainly to let the user know the functions of the network application. Clicking the button of Let's Go allows the user to enter the corresponding function.

For the first page, I deleted the music player section because I added the music bar to my task list, timer and Content Management. So the home page has only three sections, and these sections will be arranged vertically on the phone screen.

## Task List page
For the Task List page, this page allows workers to upload and manage their own tasks. Users can see the task name, duedate, estimated completion time, priority, and completion status. In the completion status section, users can add their own notes.

In programming, I found that in the previous stage of mockup, I did not consider the part of adding input, so I added the part of input in my programming. And considering the word count of the note, I modified the page layout.

## Time Management page
On this page, users can set their own rest and study durations, and use a stopwatch to time them.

On the basis of Mockup, I unified the layout of the page and the tasklist page. In this page, whenever the user completes the time period set by him, the page will remind him, this page is also equipped with a stopwatch, which can help the user to record additional time, such as the time to complete the task.

## Content Management page
This page helps users manage their references, where users can add web page information.

In this page, I added input part instead of mock up. And in this page, as long as the user's information is relatively complete, it can help the user to generate a reference in the format of APA6.

## Music Player
I modified the music player into a music bar and added it to each part, which makes it easier for users to listen to music. They don't have to open multiple web pages in order to listen to music.

## Mobile terminal adaptation
I have added mobile adaptations to all web pages.
